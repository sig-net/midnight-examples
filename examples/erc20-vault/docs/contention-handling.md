# Contention handling

Many users drive the vault at once, and every Midnight transaction is proven
against the ledger state its prover saw. When a transaction reaches the chain,
each value it read must still hold. If another transaction changed one of those
values in between, the later transaction fails and has to be re-proven against
the new state. Two transactions that only touch different indexes of the same map
never conflict. Two transactions that both read a single shared cell and one of
them writes it always can.

Some vault state is genuinely shared by every request. The vault's rule is
that such state has exactly one writer: `flushQueue`. Every other circuit works
only on entries keyed by its own request, so the circuits users call (start,
send, queue an attestation, complete) never conflict with the flush, and calls
for different requests never conflict with each other. All contention is
concentrated in the flush, where it is cheap to
handle: a flush carries no user funds or secrets, anyone may submit one, and a
flush that loses a race is simply rebuilt from the new state and resubmitted.
The price of a lost race is the losing flush's fee.

## The shared cells

| Cell             | Read and written by              | Holds                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `globalLastSeen` | `flushQueue` (and `initialise`)  | the highest block height of any attestation the flush has folded |
| `vaultAccountNonce` | `flushQueue`                     | the vault EVM account's next nonce                               |

`globalLastSeen` is the safety bound every settlement checks: an attestation
settles a request only if it comes from a block strictly above every height the
vault had seen when it accepted that request (see
[The last seen height](#the-last-seen-height)). `initialise` sets it to the
current EVM height.

`vaultAccountNonce` hands each request the vault's own account signs a nonce no
other request holds (see [Vault-signed requests](#vault-signed-requests)). It
starts at 0, as every deployment derives a fresh vault account from its own
contract address.

## Buffers

Requests and attestations each pass through a pair of buffers: an input buffer
that users write to and an output buffer that only the flush inserts into.
Completion removes the entries it consumes from both output buffers. Each entry
lives under its own index, so writes by different users never collide.

| Ledger field              | Index                                | Written by          | Removed by          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `inputRequestBuffer`      | a caller-chosen random index         | the start circuit   | the flush           |
| `outputRequestBuffer`     | the request index of the flushed entry | the flush          | the complete circuit |
| `inputAttestationBuffer`  | the request id                       | `queueAttestation*` | the flush           |
| `outputAttestationBuffer` | the request id                       | the flush           | the complete circuit |
| `evictionMap`             | the request id                       | the send circuit    | the complete circuit |

A request entry (`RequestBufferEntry`) has one size for every action. It
carries:

- **The action.**
- **The nonce.** `useNextVaultAccountNonce` is `false` when the caller names the nonce,
  which is taken verbatim: a deposit names the depositor's own account nonce,
  and a nonce replacement carries the vault account nonce of the sent request
  it replaces. It is
  `true` for a withdrawal, a swap, a supply, a redeem or an approval, which
  the vault's account signs at a nonce the caller does not choose: the start
  writes 0, and the flush replaces it with the vault's next nonce.
- **The input index** it was queued under, which is public already.
- **An ownership commitment**, `ownershipCommitment(inIndex, secret key)`. The
  complete circuit recomputes it from the stored index and the caller's
  secret, so only the requester can complete.
- **An args hash**, committing to the action's own arguments.

The arguments themselves live in the action's own args map, keyed by the input
index: `depositArgsMap` holds each deposit's `DepositArgs` (the
`DepositRequest`, the MPC derivation path of the depositor's EVM account, and
the gas envelope), `withdrawArgsMap` each withdrawal's `WithdrawArgs` (the
`WithdrawRequest` and the vault's gas envelope at start), `approveArgsMap`
each approval's `ApproveArgs` (the `ApproveRequest`, naming the ERC20 and the
spender, and the vault's gas envelope at start), `replaceNonceArgsMap` each
nonce replacement's `ReplaceNonceArgs` (the vault's gas envelope at start),
`swapArgsMap` each swap's `SwapArgs` (the `SwapRequest` and the vault's gas
envelope at start), `supplyArgsMap` each supply's `SupplyArgs` (the
`SupplyRequest`, naming the amount, and the vault's gas envelope at start),
and `redeemArgsMap` each redeem's `RedeemArgs` (the `RedeemRequest`, naming
the shares, and the vault's gas envelope at start).
The start circuit writes them, the send and complete circuits read
them, and the complete circuit removes them. The flush never touches them, so
its cost does not grow with the actions the vault supports.
The start circuit refuses an index that either the input buffer or its args
map already holds.

The flush stores the entry in `outputRequestBuffer` together with the
`lastSeen` height at that moment, under the entry's **request index**
(`requestIndex`): a hash of the nonce and the args hash, which together
determine the EVM transaction. Each action's args hash starts with a domain tag
no other action uses, and each action fixes whether the nonce is the vault's,
so the index needs neither the action nor the nonce flag. It deliberately leaves
out the input index and the ownership commitment, so two identical requests
share one request index.

The entry and its arguments fix every byte of the EVM transaction, gas
included, so sending is permissionless and chooses nothing. The send never
writes to an output buffer. It records the request in the action's event map
and the request id in `evictionMap` (request id to request index), which is how
the queue and complete circuits find the entry from an attestation. A second
send of the same entry builds the same request id, which the event map already
holds, so each entry is sent exactly once.

An attestation record (`AttestationRecord`) holds the block height, the output
kind and the attestation digest, stored under its request id. It holds no
output: the complete circuit passes the serialised output again and checks it
against the digest, so one record type and one pair of buffers serve every
output width.

## The deposit lifecycle

A deposit takes six transactions from start to completion. Only the two
flushes touch shared state.

1. **Start.** The depositor calls `startDeposit` with a random input index,
   their account's nonce, the gas envelope and the `DepositRequest`. It writes
   the arguments into `depositArgsMap` and the entry into `inputRequestBuffer`.
2. **Flush the request.** A flush moves the entry to `outputRequestBuffer`
   under its request index and records the current `globalLastSeen` as its
   `lastSeen`.
3. **Send.** Anyone calls `sendDeposit` with the request index. It builds the
   sign bidirectional request from the entry and its arguments, records it in
   `bidirectionalDepositMap`, writes `evictionMap`, and notifies the MPC.
4. **Queue the attestation.** Once the MPC has attested the EVM outcome,
   anyone calls the queue circuit for the output's width (`queueAttestation1`
   for an executed transfer, `queueAttestation0` for a failed or unviable one).
   It verifies the MPC's signature, finds the entry through `evictionMap`,
   checks that the attestation's block height is above the entry's
   `lastSeen`, and writes the record into `inputAttestationBuffer` under the
   request id.
5. **Flush the attestation.** A flush moves the record to
   `outputAttestationBuffer` and raises `globalLastSeen` to its block height if
   that height is higher.
6. **Complete.** The depositor calls `completeDeposit` with the request id, the
   serialised output, a mint nonce and an optional recipient. It checks that
   the record's block height is strictly above the entry's `lastSeen` and that
   the caller owns the entry, then removes the request's event, its arguments,
   its `evictionMap` entry, the attestation and the output entry. It then
   branches on the verdict:
   - **Executed:** it checks that the output hashes to the record's digest,
     and mints the deposited amount when the attested transfer returned true.
     A transfer that returned false only closes the request.
   - **Failed or unviable:** nothing was surrendered, so it only closes the
     request, and the output it was passed is ignored.

## The flush

`flushQueue` takes a vector of 10 slots. Each slot names a channel and an index:

- **Request slot.** Moves one entry from `inputRequestBuffer` to
  `outputRequestBuffer`, recording `globalLastSeen` as its `lastSeen`. A
  vault-signed entry also takes `vaultAccountNonce` as its nonce, which then
  advances by one.
- **Attestation slot.** Moves one record from `inputAttestationBuffer` to
  `outputAttestationBuffer` and folds its block height into `globalLastSeen`.
- **Empty slot.** Does nothing, so a flush with fewer than 10 waiting items is
  still a valid call.

A slot whose index is not in its input buffer fails the whole flush, with
`Request not queued` or `Attestation not queued`. So does a request slot whose
twin (an entry with the same request index) is still open, with `Identical
request open`: the twin stays in `inputRequestBuffer`, and a later flush moves
it once the open request settles. The flush fails when it is built, so it
commits nothing and takes no vault nonce. A flush fails only on the items its
caller names, so what a user queues can never fail someone else's flush.

Slots run in order, so within one flush a request slot placed after an
attestation slot sees that attestation's height in its `lastSeen`.

Flushing is permissionless, and a flush carries whichever waiting items its
caller chooses. A flusher can leave an item out, but it cannot stop anyone
else flushing it, and a user whose request is waiting can always flush it
themselves. The flush does not have to take every waiting item: a rule forcing
it to would make it read a count that every start writes, and every start would
then conflict with every flush.

Two flushes built against the same state conflict when they carry a common
item, when one raises `globalLastSeen` and the other read it (every slot that
moves an item reads it), or when both move a vault-signed request (each reads
and advances `vaultAccountNonce`). A slot that moves a caller-signed request never
reads `vaultAccountNonce`. One of them lands, and the other is rebuilt and
resubmitted. Only the flusher ever retries. Users' own transactions never fail
because of a flush.

The SDK's `flushPending` fills the slots from the ledger, up to 10 items: the
items its caller names first, then queued attestations, then queued requests,
each in ledger order. It leaves out a caller-signed request whose twin is open,
or whose request index an earlier request in the batch already takes, as it would
fail the flush, and it submits nothing when no item would move. A
vault-signed request is never left out: its index covers the nonce the flush
assigns, so it has no twin, and for the same reason its index is known only after
its flush (`flushedRequestIndex` reads it). So another user's waiting repeats
cannot fill a caller's flush, and `flushUntil` puts the items the caller waits
for into every flush it submits.

The SDK's `flushPending` submits every flush with its whole transcript in the
transaction's fallible section, which runs after the fee is paid. Before taking
a fee, a node must be able to reject a transaction cheaply: it refuses one
whose proof check plus guaranteed section takes longer than
`max(15 ms, 2 µs per byte)`. midnight-js chooses the section before the wallet
adds its fee payment, so on its own it leaves a one-item flush in the
guaranteed section, where the payment then pushes it past that limit. In the
fallible section only the proof check and the payment count. The same choice
means a flush that loses a race still lands, as a failed fallible section, and
pays its fee.

## The last seen height

An MPC attestation names a request id and the height of the finalised EVM
block that settled it. The vault must never settle a request with an
attestation that describes anything other than that request's own
transaction. The `lastSeen` check is how the vault guarantees it for every
request, whatever its action: an attestation settles an entry only if its
block height is strictly greater than the entry's `lastSeen`. It is the
pattern for consuming MPC attestations safely, and the vault applies it
without exception.

The guarantee rests on three orderings the design enforces:

- **An attestation is consumed only after its height is folded.** The
  complete circuit reads from `outputAttestationBuffer`, which only the flush
  fills, and the flush raises `globalLastSeen` as it does.
- **An entry's bound is taken when it is flushed.** Its `lastSeen` is
  `globalLastSeen` at that moment, so it is at least the height of every
  attestation the vault had folded before accepting the request.
- **An identical request waits for the first to close.** The request index
  keeps an identical second request in `inputRequestBuffer` until the first is
  settled, and settling needs the first request's attestation to be folded.
  So the second request's `lastSeen` is at least that attestation's height,
  and replaying the first attestation against it fails.

A deposit shows why this matters. Its EVM transaction is determined by the
depositor (their derived account, their nonce, their token and amount, and the
gas they choose), so an identical second deposit can produce the identical
request id. The MPC would observe the same finalised transaction and issue
exactly the attestation that settled the first deposit. The `lastSeen` check
rejects it. An identical repeat of a deposit therefore never settles: it shares
the first deposit's nonce, which the first deposit's transaction consumed, so
every attestation of it describes a block the vault has already folded.

A real attestation for a new request passes: its transaction is signed only
after the entry was flushed, so it lands in a block strictly above every height
the flush had seen. One case does not pass. A deposit names the depositor's own
nonce, and when another transaction consumed that nonce before the flush, the
MPC attests the request unviable at that transaction's block, which can lie at
or below the entry's `lastSeen`. Such a deposit stays open, with nothing lost,
as a deposit surrenders nothing at start.

The vault trusts the MPC: it attests each request id once, at the height of
the finalised block holding the transaction the attestation describes, as the
Signet protocol defines it.

## Why the queue takes the full output

The MPC signs one digest over the request id, block height, output kind,
output length and the raw serialised output together
(`calculateSignetAttestationDigestV1` in `@sig-net/midnight`). A signature
check against the digest alone proves the MPC signed something, but not which
block height it signed: recovering that needs the output. Without it, anyone
could pair a real digest and signature with an arbitrary height, and the flush
would fold that height into `globalLastSeen`. A height of `2^64 - 1` would stop
every later request from ever settling.

So each queue circuit takes the output at its exact width and recomputes the
digest before recording anything. Compact cannot export a width-generic
circuit, so there is one queue circuit per output width the vault uses. Only
the record's storage is width-independent.

## Invariants the circuits keep

- **Only the flush writes shared state.** No circuit other than `flushQueue`
  and `initialise` reads or writes `globalLastSeen`, and none other than
  `flushQueue` reads or writes `vaultAccountNonce`.
- **Only the flush inserts into an output buffer.** Send writes the event map
  and `evictionMap`, and the complete circuit only removes.
- **The flush never touches arguments.** An action's arguments go into its
  args map at start and leave it at complete, so the flush moves a small entry
  of one size whatever the action.
- **A request is sent at most once.** The entry and its arguments fix the
  whole EVM transaction, so a second send builds the same request id, and the
  send refuses an id the action's event map already holds.
- **An attestation settles at most once.** The complete circuit removes the
  output entry, the `evictionMap` entry and the attestation, and fails when
  any of them is absent. Attestations are public and stay validly signed
  forever, so anything less would let one be queued and settled again.
- **Only attestations for sent, open requests are queued.** The queue circuits
  find the entry through `evictionMap` and check its `lastSeen`, which keeps
  junk and stale attestations out of the flush's slots.
- **Queued attestations never overwrite each other.** Both attestation buffers
  are keyed by request id, and queueing refuses a request id either already
  holds.
- **Sending is permissionless.** The send chooses nothing: the requester fixed
  the gas at start, so whoever sends only pays the Midnight fee.

## Vault-signed requests

A withdrawal, a swap, a supply, a redeem or an approval is signed by the
vault's own EVM account, so it needs the account's next nonce, and no two
requests may get the same one. That
nonce is the second shared cell, and it follows the same rule: the flush is its
only reader and writer.

- **A request slot assigns it.** An entry with `useNextVaultAccountNonce` set takes the
  current `vaultAccountNonce` before its request index is computed, and the cell
  advances only once the entry moves. Assigning before advancing gives the
  first vault request nonce 0, the account's next unused nonce: any other start
  would leave every later vault transaction waiting behind a nonce no request
  uses. A flush that fails on any slot commits nothing, so it never burns a
  nonce.
- **Such requests never collide.** Each carries a nonce the flush assigned
  once, so their request indexes are unique and they never wait as twins, even
  when two withdrawals are otherwise identical.
- **Every flushed vault request can be sent.** Sends are permissionless, so a
  nonce the flush assigned never waits on its requester to reach the MPC.

The withdraw lifecycle is the deposit's six steps with three differences:

1. **Start.** `startWithdraw` takes the input index, the `WithdrawRequest` and
   the vault coin of the ERC20, whose value must equal the amount. It burns the
   coin, copies the vault's gas settings into `withdrawArgsMap`, and queues the
   entry with `useNextVaultAccountNonce` set.
2. **Send.** `sendWithdraw` builds `transfer(destEvmAddress, amount)` on the
   ERC20 with the derivation path `"vault"` and the nonce the flush assigned,
   and records it in `bidirectionalWithdrawMap`.
3. **Complete.** `completeWithdraw` settles every verdict. A transfer that
   returned true moved the tokens, so the burn stands. One that returned false,
   failed or was unviable moved nothing, so it re-mints the burned amount to
   the withdrawer.

The approve lifecycle is the same six steps. It lets the vault's account grant
one of its two pinned spenders an allowance the later EVM calls draw on: the
Uniswap router for a swap, the stataToken wrapper for a supply. Both approvals
share one action, one event map and one args map, as they build the same
transaction:

1. **Start.** Only the deployer may start an approval.
   `startApproveRouter` takes the input index and the ERC20, and names the
   pinned `uniswapRouter` as the spender. `startApproveStata` takes only the
   input index, and names the pinned `stataToken` as the spender on
   `stataUnderlying`. Either copies the vault's gas settings into
   `approveArgsMap` and queues the entry with `useNextVaultAccountNonce` set. Nothing is
   surrendered.
2. **Send.** `sendApprove` builds `approve(spender, unlimitedAllowance())` on
   the ERC20 with the derivation path `"vault"` and the nonce the flush
   assigned, and records it in `bidirectionalApproveMap`.
3. **Complete.** `completeApprove` settles every verdict by closing the
   request. It mints nothing, as the start surrendered nothing.

The swap lifecycle is the same six steps. It buys an exact amount of one ERC20
with at most a capped amount of another, through the pinned Uniswap router and
the allowance a router approval granted:

1. **Start.** `startSwap` takes the input index, the `SwapRequest` and the
   vault coin of `erc20AddressIn`, whose value must equal `amountInMaximum`.
   It burns the coin, copies the vault's gas settings into `swapArgsMap`, and
   queues the entry with `useNextVaultAccountNonce` set.
2. **Send.** `sendSwap` builds `exactOutputSingle` on `uniswapRouter`, buying
   exactly `amountOut` of `erc20AddressOut` for at most `amountInMaximum` of
   `erc20AddressIn` and delivering it to `vaultEvmAddress`, with the
   derivation path `"vault"` and the nonce the flush assigned, and records it
   in `bidirectionalSwapMap`.
3. **Queue the attestation.** The MPC decodes the router's `uint256` return,
   the input the swap spent, and attests it packed as a `uint64`, so an
   executed swap is queued with `queueAttestation8`.
4. **Complete.** `completeSwap` settles every verdict. An executed swap mints
   exactly `amountOut` of `erc20AddressOut` and the unspent
   `amountInMaximum - amountIn` of `erc20AddressIn` as change, a zero-value
   coin on an exact spend, under two caller-chosen nonces that must differ. A
   failed or unviable swap spent nothing, so it re-mints `amountInMaximum` of
   `erc20AddressIn`. Every mint goes to the swapper.

The supply lifecycle is the same six steps. It deposits the vault account's
pinned `stataUnderlying` into the pinned `stataToken` wrapper (an ERC-4626
tokenised vault) for shares, drawing on the allowance the stata approval grants:

1. **Start.** `startSupply` takes the input index, the `SupplyRequest` and the
   vault coin of `stataUnderlying`, whose value must equal the amount. It burns
   the coin, copies the vault's gas settings into `supplyArgsMap`, and queues
   the entry with `useNextVaultAccountNonce` set. Both tokens are contract-fixed, so the
   request names only the amount.
2. **Send.** `sendSupply` builds `deposit(amount, vaultEvmAddress)` on
   `stataToken` with the derivation path `"vault"` and the nonce the flush
   assigned, and records it in `bidirectionalSupplyMap`.
3. **Queue the attestation.** The MPC decodes the wrapper's uint256 share
   count and re-packs it as a uint64, so an executed supply is queued with
   `queueAttestation8`, and a failed or unviable one with `queueAttestation0`.
4. **Complete.** `completeSupply` settles every verdict. An executed deposit
   minted shares to the vault account, so it mints the attested share count
   as the `stataToken` vault coin to the supplier. A failed or unviable one
   moved nothing, so it re-mints the burned `stataUnderlying` amount.

The redeem lifecycle is the same six steps, the supply's in reverse. It
redeems shares the vault account holds in the pinned `stataToken` wrapper for
the `stataUnderlying` they are worth. The vault account owns the shares it
burns, so no approval is involved:

1. **Start.** `startRedeem` takes the input index, the `RedeemRequest` and the
   vault coin of `stataToken`, whose value must equal the shares. It burns the
   coin, copies the vault's gas settings into `redeemArgsMap`, and queues the
   entry with `useNextVaultAccountNonce` set. Both tokens are contract-fixed, so the
   request names only the shares.
2. **Send.** `sendRedeem` builds `redeem(shares, vaultEvmAddress,
   vaultEvmAddress)` on `stataToken` with the derivation path `"vault"` and the
   nonce the flush assigned, and records it in `bidirectionalRedeemMap`.
3. **Queue the attestation.** The MPC decodes the wrapper's uint256 asset
   amount and re-packs it as a uint64, so an executed redeem is queued with
   `queueAttestation8`, and a failed or unviable one with `queueAttestation0`.
4. **Complete.** `completeRedeem` settles every verdict. An executed redeem
   paid the vault account the underlying, so it mints the attested asset
   amount as the `stataUnderlying` vault coin to the redeemer. A failed or
   unviable one burned nothing, so it re-mints the surrendered shares.

## Nonce replacement

A vault-signed transaction that can never be mined (its fee below what the
network will take, or never broadcast at all) holds its nonce, and every
later vault transaction waits behind it. The deployer unsticks the account by
replacing that nonce with a zero-value self-transfer, the Replace nonce
section of the contract. It runs the same six steps with these differences:

1. **Start.** `startReplaceNonce` is deployer-gated and takes the input index
   and the sent request to replace, as a request id and its action. It reads
   the nonce from that request's event in the action's map, so only a nonce
   the flush assigned and a send handed to the MPC can be replaced: a deposit
   is refused, as the caller's account signs it, and so is a request that is
   not sent under the named action or has already settled. It copies the
   vault's fee settings at a 21000 gas limit into `replaceNonceArgsMap`, and
   queues the entry with `useNextVaultAccountNonce` unset, so the flush takes that nonce
   verbatim and leaves `vaultAccountNonce` alone.
2. **Send.** `sendReplaceNonce` builds the transfer of zero to
   `vaultEvmAddress`, with no calldata, under the derivation path `"vault"`,
   and records it in `bidirectionalReplaceNonceMap`.
3. **Queue the attestation.** The MPC attests an executed plain transfer with
   the success value it synthesises from the bool schema, one `0x01` byte, so
   an executed replacement is queued with `queueAttestation1`. A client
   recomputes that byte from the respond schema with the SDK's
   `executedEvmRespondOutput`, as the mined transfer returns no data.
4. **Complete.** `completeReplaceNonce` closes the request on every verdict,
   as the replacement surrendered nothing.

The request whose nonce was replaced can then never execute. The MPC attests
it unviable at the block holding the replacement, which lies above its
`lastSeen`, and its complete circuit takes the failure branch: a withdrawal
re-mints what it burned. An MPC that posts no attestation for a replaced
request leaves it open, and whatever it surrendered stays burned. A
replacement that races the original transaction decides which of the two
mines, so the deployer replaces a nonce only when the original is in flight
nowhere.

## Costs

- **Latency.** Settling needs a second flush after the MPC attests, so a round
  trip is six Midnight transactions.
- **Flush throughput.** Every request uses two flush slots over its life, one
  for its entry and one for its attestation, so a 10-slot flush carries the
  equivalent of 5 complete requests.
- **Serial flushes.** Concurrent flushes of the same waiting items conflict
  (see [The flush](#the-flush)), so under load flushes land one after another,
  and throughput is bounded by the flush width and the flush rate, not by the
  number of users.
- **No gas bump.** A request's gas is fixed at start, so a deposit queued with
  too little gas to be mined stays pending until the network fee falls to meet
  it. A vault-signed request is fixed to the vault's gas settings at its start,
  and while its transaction waits, every later vault transaction waits behind
  its nonce.
- **No cancel.** No circuit closes an open request without an attestation that
  passes the bound. A request that is sent but never mined, or attested stale,
  stays in `outputRequestBuffer`, and it keeps its identical repeats in
  `inputRequestBuffer`.
