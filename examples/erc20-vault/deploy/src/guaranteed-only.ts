// Sig's fallibility model, part one: Sig signs only for calls that land in
// the GUARANTEED section of their transaction.
//
// Midnight's transaction builder decides the section at construction time,
// from the transcript's estimated execution cost (midnight-ledger
// `construct.rs`, `partition_transcripts`). A call that does not fit the
// guaranteed budget is demoted WHOLE to the fallible section, with no error
// — and a fallible section can fail at landing after fees are paid, dropping
// the request the signer's event would have announced. The Compact circuit
// cannot know which side it lands on, so the check lives here, on the built
// transaction, before it is proven.
//
// Duplicated from `@sig-net/midnight`'s `guaranteedOnlyProofProvider` so the
// example reads standalone; import it from there once the published version
// carries it.
