 * bytes (nonce + fields + signature) — so the protocol guarantees it can only
 * ever mine once. This function leans on that: it derives the hash locally,
 * short-circuits if the tx has already mined (whether it succeeded OR reverted),
 * and tolerates the node reporting the tx as already-submitted on a re-run.
 *
 * The one case it cannot make idempotent is a *burned nonce*: if the account's
 * nonce has advanced past this tx but this tx never mined, some other
 * transaction took the slot and this one can never land. That is surfaced as an
 * error rather than hung on.
 *
 * @param context - The flow context.
 * @param options - The transaction to broadcast.
 * @returns The EVM transaction hash.
 * @throws Error when the transaction reverted on-chain, or its nonce was
 *   consumed by a different transaction (so it can never mine).
