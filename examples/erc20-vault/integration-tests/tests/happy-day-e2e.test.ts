// round trip, against contracts the globalSetup pipeline (src/setup.ts) has
// already compiled/deployed/derived — vitest.config.ts holds the
// orchestration contract (setup runs first, flow files run one at a time in
// a pinned order). Tests in THIS file run in source order and feed each
// other through module-scoped state, so the file is one ordered pipeline on
// purpose. Run with `yarn test:erc20-vault:e2e` from the repo root (--bail 1
// stops the pipeline at the first failure); without RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS
// the whole suite skips so plain `yarn test` stays offline. Set
// STEP_THROUGH=1 to pause before each step (after the first) until you hit
// Enter in the terminal.
//
// Tests drive the vault THROUGH the example's typed flow functions
// (src/flows/) — in-process, never a subprocess.
