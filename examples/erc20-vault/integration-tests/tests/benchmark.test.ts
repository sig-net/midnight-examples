// The benchmark e2e flow: one full deposit round trip and one full withdraw
// round trip, every leg driven LONG-HAND (one flow call per test) with an
// explicit stopwatch started and stopped around exactly the call under
// measurement — never inside a flow helper, so timing is visible at the call
// site and flows that don't measure never time in the background. One leg
// per test also means a narrowed vitest selection can benchmark the smallest
// unit on its own (just deposit, just claim). The measured
// legs: request/prove (deposit / withdraw), MPC signature
// latency (pollSignatureResponse), EVM confirmation (broadcastEvm),
// attestation latency (pollRespondBidirectional), and claim/settle proving
// (claim / completeWithdraw).
//
// REPORTING ONLY, by design: there is no assertion budget — a regression
// gate needs baseline data first. "Report" means (a) a human-readable
// banner table and (b) one machine-greppable `BENCHMARK_TIMINGS_JSON {...}`
// line per run, so baselines can be scraped from run logs. Deposit and
// withdraw timings stay in SEPARATE records: both round trips share leg
// names (pollSignatureResponse, broadcastEvm, pollRespondBidirectional),
// so merging them would collide. Legs a resumed/rerun pass skipped are
// absent from the report — never fabricated or resume-skewed.
//
// The flow cycles the suite's funds like the happy-day file: the deposit
// sweeps 0.1 USDC user → vault, the withdraw transfers it vault → user.
// Run AFTER tests/happy-day-e2e.test.ts (FILE_ORDER): initialize lives
// there. Recovery from a run that died mid-flow (proof-server OOM): rerun
// this file with BENCHMARK_DEPOSIT_REQUEST_ID / BENCHMARK_WITHDRAW_REQUEST_ID
// set to the ids the failed run printed.
//
// Tests drive the vault THROUGH the example's typed flow functions
// (src/flows/) — in-process, never a subprocess.
