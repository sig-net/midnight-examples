// The false-claimer e2e flow: the vault's in-circuit caller-identity check.
// A deposit request records the DEPOSITOR's identity commitment as its MPC
// derivation path; claim recomputes the caller's commitment from the
// callerSecretKey witness and asserts it matches — so a deposit recorded for
// identity A must NOT be claimable by identity B, even with the MPC's valid
// success attestation posted.
//
// Arrange: a deposit round trip up to but NOT including the claim
// (src/flows/deposit.ts with skipClaim). Act: attempt claim through a
// SECOND session whose USER_SEED and VAULT_USER_SECRET_KEY both differ from
// the depositor's — both must be overridden together: a changed secret under
// the SAME seed would hit midnight-js's persisted private state
// (midnight-level-db, scoped per wallet account), and the stale identity
// would win. A distinct seed gets its own clean slot. The false claimer's
// wallet never pays anything — the circuit rejects during local transaction
// building, before proving or balancing — so its seed needs no funding.
// Assert: the claim rejects with the circuit's identity-assert message and
// the request STAYS on the ledger. Then identity A claims it for real (no
// stranded deposit), and the fakenet-only drain returns the deposited ERC20
// to EVM_USER_ADDRESS, so the suite's EVM funds keep cycling.
//
// Run AFTER tests/happy-day-e2e.test.ts (FILE_ORDER): initialize lives
// there. Recovery from a run that died mid-flow (proof-server OOM): rerun
// this file with FALSE_CLAIMER_DEPOSIT_REQUEST_ID set to the id the failed
// run printed.
//
// Tests drive the vault THROUGH the example's typed flow functions
// (src/flows/) — in-process, never a subprocess.
