// The claimant-is-not-the-recipient e2e flow: claim takes an OPTIONAL
// mint recipient, so the depositor (the only identity allowed to claim) can
// direct the freshly minted shielded vault tokens to a DIFFERENT wallet's
// Zswap coin public key. This flow proves that end to end: a deposit round
// trip claims with `recipient` set to a second wallet, and that wallet —
// built from its own seed and synced from chain — must see the minted coin in
// its shielded balance for the vault token's color. The mint itself is
// shielded, so the recipient wallet's balance delta (plus the request's
// public removal from the vault ledger) IS the observable outcome.
//
// The recipient wallet never spends anything (the session wallet pays all
// fees), so it needs no funding — only a seed. Its balance assertions are
// DELTA-based: the fixed seed may accumulate tokens across runs.
//
// The claimed tokens strand on the recipient wallet (this flow does not
// withdraw them), so the deposited ERC20 would strand on the vault's EVM
// account run after run — the final step drains it back to EVM_USER_ADDRESS
// with the fakenet-only vault key (see src/fakenet-vault-account.ts), the
// same fund-cycling move the failure-refund flow uses. Run AFTER
// tests/happy-day-e2e.test.ts (FILE_ORDER): initialize lives there. Recovery
// from a run that died mid-flow (proof-server OOM): rerun this file with
// DEPOSIT_CLAIMANT_NOT_CALLER_DEPOSIT_REQUEST_ID set to the id the failed
// run printed.
//
// Tests drive the vault THROUGH the example's typed flow functions
// (src/flows/) — in-process, never a subprocess.
