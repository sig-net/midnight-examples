// The failure-refund e2e flow: a withdraw whose EVM transfer FAILS must end
// with the MPC attesting failure and completeWithdraw taking the REFUND
// branch in-circuit — the escrowed shielded vault tokens re-minted to the
// caller, the request + its pending-withdrawal marker consumed.
//
// Failure-injection strategy (deliberate, deterministic): make the withdraw
// transfer MINE and REVERT by draining the vault's EVM ERC20 balance first.
// The responder (fakenet compose service) attests an EVM outcome only from a
// mined receipt (success or revert) or a consumed nonce — it never times out
// a forever-pending tx — and a mined `status 0` receipt is exactly what its
// failure attestation (the 0xdeadbeef error sentinel) is for. The drain
// signs with the vault account's fakenet-derived key (test-support only, see
// src/fakenet-vault-account.ts) and sends the balance back to
// EVM_USER_ADDRESS, so the suite's EVM funds keep cycling. Amounts are
// computed from live balances, never assumed.
//
// The arrange stage runs a full deposit round trip first (the caller must
// hold shielded vault tokens to escrow) — that is what
// src/flows/deposit.ts's runDepositRoundTrip exists for. Run AFTER
// tests/happy-day-e2e.test.ts (FILE_ORDER): initialize lives there. Recovery
// from a run that died mid-flow (proof-server OOM): rerun this file with
// FAILURE_REFUND_DEPOSIT_REQUEST_ID / FAILURE_REFUND_WITHDRAW_REQUEST_ID set
// to the ids the failed run printed.
//
// Tests drive the vault THROUGH the example's typed flow functions
// (src/flows/) — in-process, never a subprocess.
