# Midnight Contracts Calling Foreign Chains with Sig Network

This monorepo holds experimental example Midnight contracts that leverage the Sig Network [Distributed MPC](https://github.com/sig-net/mpc) to execute arbitrary transactions on foreign blockchains through integration of the [Sign Bidirectional Protocol Flow](#sign-bidirectional-protocol-flow).

The examples demonstrate how to integrate using the following packages:
- [`@sig-net/midnight`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sig-net/midnight): the
  client-agnostic protocol library (the shared Compact modules, state readers,
  event decoders, request feed and crypto helpers).
- [`@sig-net/midnight-contract`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sig-net/midnight-contract):
  the central Signet singleton contract.
- [`@sig-net/midnight-contract-deploy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sig-net/midnight-contract-deploy):
  deploy tooling for that contract plus generic Midnight deploy and wallet
  plumbing. Used here by the test harness to deploy the singleton for the
  local e2e stack.

## Reading Guide
- Start by reading the [Sign Bidirectional Flow](#sign-bidirectional-protocol-flow) to understand the fundamentals of the cross chain protocol.
- Then go through the [Integration guide](#integrator-guide) to see how to wire your own applications with Sig Network to make cross chain calls.
- Or jump straight into complete [examples](#examples) to see applications of the protocol.

If you are looking for the parts of the Sig Network stack that these examples are built upon, visit:

- [Sig Network Distributed MPC Repository](https://github.com/sig-net/mpc)

# Examples

Each example is a directory under [`examples/`](examples/) holding up to four packages, split by what the code is: `contract` (required), plus `client`, `deploy` and `integration-tests` as warranted.

# Sign Bidirectional Protocol Flow

This Sig Network Protocol Flow brings foreign blockchain assets and functionality to contracts on Midnight. Contracts record signature requests that the Sig Network MPC signs. dApps relay signed transactions to foreign chains and the MPC attests their execution outcomes back to Midnight. Then contracts complete cross chain interactions with in-circuit validation of the MPC foreign execution attestation.

Illustrated below, the protocol is best understood in 5 steps:

<img src="./docs/sign-bidirectional-flow.drawio.png">

1. A user interacts with a dApp, which starts a cross chain interaction by calling a circuit (`startCrossChain(...)` in the diagram) on a contract on Midnight that has integrated with Sig Network.
2. The MPC network, watching for events on the Singleton contract, picks up the emitted **SignBidirectionalEventNotification** and honours the signature request it points to.
3. The integrating dApp, watching for events on the Singleton contract, picks up the emitted **SignatureRespondedEvent** and relays the fully signed transaction to the foreign chain.
4. The MPC network observes execution of the signed transaction on the foreign blockchain and posts an attestation thereof back to Midnight.
5. The integrating dApp collects the execution output and its attestation and submits both back to the integrating contract, completing the cross chain interaction.

Consult the [protocol documentation in the Midnight integration repository](https://github.com/sig-net/midnight-integration/blob/main/README.md#sign-bidirectional-protocol-flow) for a more detailed description of the protocol including:
  - MPC key derivation and signing
  - MPC discovery and verification of the Sign Bidirectional Event signature requests
  - MPC & Client foreign transaction execution output recovery (including failed transaction flow)
  - MPC foreign transaction execution & failure attestation
  - Handling foreign transaction execution failure

# Integrator Guide

Integrating a contract on Midnight with the Sig Network MPC requires 4 once-off setup
steps and 5 per-request runtime steps.

Setup entails:
1. Installing `@sig-net/midnight` into your project.
2. Importing the Signet Compact module into your contract.
3. Declaring the required protocol state in your ledger (the `SignBidirectionalEventMap` your requests live in and the `SignetSigner` singleton reference your circuits call cross contract to notify the MPC of requests).
4. Setting the contract's own `mpcResponseKey` with an initialisation circuit call after deploy (its derivation takes the contract's address as input, which exists only once the contract is deployed).

At runtime you integrate the [Sign Bidirectional Flow above](#sign-bidirectional-protocol-flow):
- **Steps 1** and **5** are circuits on your contract.
- **Steps 2**, **3** and **4** are off-chain client/dApp/relayer code built on the readers and helpers in `@sig-net/midnight`.

Consult the [Integrator Guide documentation](https://github.com/sig-net/midnight-integration/blob/main/README.md#integrator-guide) in the Midnight integration repository for a more detailed description of how to integrate.

# Contributor Guide

First install the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), then get set up for contributing by getting both test layers green: the offline unit tests, then the end to end integration suites.

Every change must also pass the linter and the formatter, which CI enforces on every pull request. One ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.js`) and one Prettier config (`.prettierrc.json`) at the repo root cover all packages, so there is nothing to configure per package. In VS Code, install the two recommended extensions the editor offers on first open (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` and `esbenp.prettier-vscode`) and both run on save.

## Compiling, Building and Running Unit Tests

Packages can be compiled (with or without generating zk keys), built and unit tested either independently or together. Only contract packages have a compile step, and only they have a zk compile option. Unit tests run offline against a simulated Midnight runtime, so zk keys are not needed before running them.

From the root of the repository:

```sh
# Install all dependencies for all workspace members once to start.
# Run this from the repository root.
yarn install

## --- Compile, build or test: All Packages (whole workspace, from repository root) ---

# Quick compile: all packages (checks syntax and generates circuits)
# Runs the compact compiler for each package without generating zk keys (compiler output in the package's src/managed/)
yarn compile

# Longer compile: all packages that require zk keys (checks syntax, generates circuits and zk keys)
# Runs the compact compiler with zk keys for each package that has a :zk option (compiler output in the package's src/managed/)
yarn compile:zk

# Test: all packages (typecheck + unit tests: offline simulator-only)
# Requires 'yarn compile' to have been run (zk keys not required for unit testing).
yarn test

# Build: all packages (typecheck)
# Requires 'yarn compile' to have been run (packages typecheck against the
# compiler's generated src/managed/ output, no zk keys required).
yarn build

## --- Linting and formatting: All packages (whole workspace, from repository root) ---

# Check formatting (Prettier). Needs nothing compiled.
yarn format:check
yarn format        # rewrite files in place

# Lint (ESLint + typescript-eslint, type-aware).
# Requires 'yarn compile': the rules read the generated src/managed/ types,
# the same reason 'yarn build' needs it.
yarn lint
yarn lint:fix      # apply every autofix

## --- Compile, build or test a single example independently ---

# The erc20-vault example (contract + client + deploy + integration-tests packages):
yarn compile:erc20-vault
yarn compile:erc20-vault:zk  # generates the vault contract's zk keys
yarn test:erc20-vault        # requires at least 'yarn compile:erc20-vault'
yarn build:erc20-vault       # requires 'yarn compile:erc20-vault'

# The erc20-vault example can also be deployed and initialised:
yarn deploy:erc20-vault             # deploy a vault, requires 'yarn compile:erc20-vault:zk'
yarn deploy-initialise:erc20-vault  # deploy + the deployer-gated initialise (remote networks)
yarn initialise:erc20-vault         # initialise an already-deployed vault (recovers a half-done run)
```

Scripts targeting one example carry that example's directory name in full
(`compile:erc20-vault`, never a shorthand), so every example gains the same
family of scripts. The task prefix decides which of the example's packages
run: `test:` and `build:` fan out over every package the example has,
`compile:` reaches only its contract package, and `deploy:` only its deploy
package.

## Integration Tests

The e2e suites need the docker stack running and the fakenet MPC responder, and
they also run from the root:

```sh
yarn test:erc20-vault:e2e                              # every spec in the suite
yarn test:erc20-vault:e2e tests/happy-day-e2e.test.ts  # one spec file
```

Getting there from a fresh clone (the `.env` file and its Sepolia fork RPC, the
zk keys, bringing the stack up, what a green first run looks like, and recovering
a run the proof server was OOM-killed in) is walked end to end in the example's
own README: [examples/erc20-vault/README.md](examples/erc20-vault/README.md).

# Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Version | Check With | Where to Get It |
| ------- | ------| ------  |----------- |
| Node | ≥ 20 (22+ recommended) | `node --version` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or your version manager (nvm, fnm, …) |
| Yarn 4 (via Corepack) | 4.x | `corepack enable && yarn --version` | Corepack ships with Node. The repo's `packageManager` field pins the Yarn version |
| Compact toolchain | compiler 0.33.0-rc.2, invoked with `--feature-zkir-v3` (see note) | `compact compile --version` → `0.33.0` | Install the `compact` launcher per [Midnight's docs](https://docs.midnight.network/), then `compact update 0.33.0-rc.2` (compiler builds live at [LFDT-Minokawa/compact releases](https://github.com/LFDT-Minokawa/compact/releases)). If the launcher refuses the rc version, use the direct-download recipe in [.github/workflows/example-test.yaml](.github/workflows/example-test.yaml) |
| A docker environment | any recent engine | `docker --version` | [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (macOS/Windows) or your distro's engine, with **≥ 16 GB RAM allocated** (see note) |
| Docker Compose v2 | ≥ 2.x | `docker compose version` | Included with Docker Desktop, plugin package on Linux |

**NOTE:** every `compact compile` against this stack must pass the
`--feature-zkir-v3` flag: it is part of the pinned ledger-9 matched set
(compiler, node, indexer, proof server), and output compiled without it is not
compatible with that stack. This repository's compile scripts already pass it.
Integrators compiling their own contracts must pass it themselves, as shown in
the [Integrator Guide](https://github.com/sig-net/midnight-integration/blob/main/README.md#integrator-guide).

**NOTE:** the midnight proof server is quite heavy. Allocate at least 16 GB of
RAM to your docker environment, otherwise expect to restart the tests multiple
times as the proof server hangs.
