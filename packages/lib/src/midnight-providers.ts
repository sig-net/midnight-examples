/**
 * Build the {@link ProofProvider} for a contract's provider set: proving via

 * resolved across a *set* of compiled-contract sources — what a
 * **cross-contract call** needs: one transaction whose call tree spans several
 * deployed contracts, each carrying its own proof, so proving must find
 * artifacts for every contract in the tree (the root and each callee). A
 * single-contract provider set is just the one-element case.
 *
 * The `ZKConfigRegistry` joins each call's canonical key location
 * (`contract:<addr>/<circuitId>?vk=<sha-256 of the deployed verifier key>`) to
 * the source whose local verifier key matches — immune to redeploys and to
 * circuit-name collisions across contracts. Pass one `ZKConfigProvider` per
 * compiled contract the call can reach (the caller plus every callee).
 *
 * Exists instead of midnight-js's own `httpClientProofProvider` because that
 * one (5.0.0-beta.3) builds a circuit-level `ProvingProvider` with only
 * `check`/`prove` — the ledger-v9 1.0.0-rc.2 shape it was released against —
 * while the ledger-v9 1.0.0-rc.3 WASM this workspace resolves (the version
 * the wallet-sdk betas pin) validates that `lookupKey` is also present and
 * throws "expected proving provider property 'lookupKey' to be a function"
 * on every circuit-call proof. This wrapper reuses midnight-js's proving
 * provider and grafts on a `lookupKey` backed by the same key-material
 * resolution its `check`/`prove` use. Delete in favor of
 * `httpClientProofProvider` once midnight-js ships a beta aligned with
 * ledger-v9 1.0.0-rc.3.
 *
 * @param proofServerUrl - The proof server's HTTP endpoint.
 * @param zkConfigProviders - One provider per compiled contract in the call tree; must be non-empty.
 * @returns The proof provider to place in a contract's midnight-js provider set.
