/**
 * Block until the operator hits Enter in the terminal, for step-through runs.
 * Input is read from `/dev/tty` directly because vitest runs tests in
 * workers, where `process.stdin` is not attached to the real terminal.
 * Output goes through console.log — NOT the tty — because vitest's live
 * reporter redraws its summary block in place and erases direct tty writes;
 * console output is coordinated with the reporter and survives.
 *
 * The read is synchronous and byte-by-byte on purpose. A streaming reader
 * (fs.createReadStream + readline) eagerly queues a second blocking read(2)
 * on the tty right after delivering the first line; destroy() cannot cancel
 * that in-flight threadpool read, and the orphaned reader swallows the next
 * Enter keypress — making every later pause require two Enters. readSync up
 * to the newline consumes exactly one line and leaves nothing in flight.
 * Crashes loudly if there is no TTY — this is only ever called when the
 * operator explicitly opts into step-through mode at an interactive terminal.
 *
 * @param index - 1-based position of the next step/test in its sequence.
 * @param total - Total number of steps/tests in the sequence.
 * @param name - The name of the step/test about to run.
